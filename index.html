Solution: Check water tank is full and properly seated. Remove and clean the water intake filter. Run the machine without a portafilter to purge air. If pump makes no noise, it may need replacement."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Slow extraction is usually caused by: Coffee ground too fine, too much coffee in the portafilter, over-tamping, or clogged shower screen or group head. Solution: Use a coarser grind setting. Measure proper dose (typically 18-20g for double shot). Tamp with consistent 30lb pressure. Clean shower screen and group head gasket."

Solution: Allow machine to cool 30 minutes and try again (thermal fuse). Test thermostat with multimeter. Check heating element continuity. Descale machine thoroughly - scale insulates heating element reducing efficiency."

Solution: Remove tip and soak in descaling solution overnight. Wait for ready indicator before steaming. Purge steam wand before and after use. If pressure gauge reads low, machine needs professional service."

Run remaining solution through. Rinse thoroughly with 2-3 full tanks of fresh water. Run steam wand to descale it too. Descale every 2-3 months in hard water areas, every 3-6 months otherwise."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Bitter espresso results from: Over-extraction (too slow/too long), water too hot, coffee too dark roasted, or dirty equipment. Solution: Use coarser grind or less coffee. Check temperature is 195-205°F. Try lighter roast beans. Clean group head, shower screen, and portafilter basket regularly. Aim for 25-30 second extraction time."

Ensure machine reaches full temperature before brewing. Increase dose by 1-2g. Check water temperature is 195-205°F. Aim for 25-30 second extraction producing 2oz output."

            "text": "Grinder issues include: Foreign object jammed in burrs, worn burrs slipping, broken burr carrier, or hopper not seated properly. Solution: Remove hopper and check for stones or hard objects. Inspect burrs for wear (replace after 500-1000 lbs of coffee). Check burr carrier isn't cracked. Ensure hopper clicks into place to engage safety switch."

            "text": "Unusual noises indicate: Air in the pump (gurgling), pump running dry (loud grinding), loose internal components (rattling), or scale buildup (whistling). Solution: Run water through without portafilter to purge air. Check water tank is full and seated. Tighten any loose screws/panels. Descale thoroughly. If pump screams constantly, it may be failing."

Every 60 shots - Backflush with cleaning powder, remove and soak shower screen, clean portafilter baskets. Monthly - Deep clean group head, descale steam wand. Every 2-6 months - Full descale. Annually - Replace group gasket, water filter. Regular cleaning prevents 80% of common problems."

            "text": "Spraying/spurting indicates: Uneven coffee distribution, channeling through coffee puck, damaged portafilter basket, or worn group head gasket. Solution: Distribute grounds evenly before tamping (WDT technique). Tamp level and consistently. Check basket for dents/damage. Replace group gasket if it's flat or cracked. Ensure portafilter seats flush against group head."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Locking issues stem from: New/swollen group head gasket, too much coffee in basket, damaged portafilter lugs, or coffee grounds on gasket rim. Solution: New gaskets need break-in period (may require force initially). Reduce coffee dose slightly. Inspect lugs aren't bent/worn. Always wipe rim of basket and group head gasket before locking. Never force - this damages components."

            "text": "Electrical trips caused by: Machine on same circuit as other high-draw appliances, faulty heating element, water in electrical components, or short in power cord. Solution: Plug into dedicated 15-20 amp circuit. Check heating element for shorts with multimeter. Ensure machine is fully dry if recently cleaned. Inspect power cord for damage. If persists, requires professional electrical repair."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Missing crema results from: Stale coffee (over 4 weeks old), under-extraction, low pressure (below 9 bars), or wrong grind/dose. Solution: Use fresh beans (2-10 days after roasting is ideal). Grind finer and increase extraction time. Check pressure gauge reads 9 bars during extraction. Use proper dose (18-20g for double)."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Water from steam wand means: Boiler not at steam temperature, just finished brewing (boiler refilling), thermostat malfunction, or low boiler pressure. Solution: Wait until steam ready indicator lights (usually 5-10 minutes). After brewing, wait 1-2 minutes for boiler to reheat. Purge wand for 2-3 seconds first. Check temperature gauge reaches steam range (250-265°F). If gauge reads low, needs professional service."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Wet pucks indicate: Three-way solenoid valve failure (semi-automatic machines), extracting too fast/too much, or grind too coarse. Solution: A slightly damp puck is normal. Very wet/soupy means valve isn't releasing pressure properly (needs replacement). Reduce output to 2oz for double shot. Grind finer. Don't knock out portafilter immediately - wait 3-5 seconds. Some wetness is normal and doesn't affect taste."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Inconsistency stems from: Inconsistent dosing/distribution, temperature fluctuations, stale or varying beans, or irregular tamping. Solution: Use a scale - dose exactly same amount each time (±0.2g). Wait for temperature stability light. Use beans from same batch within 2-4 week window. Use calibrated tamper and tamp with same pressure. Time shots and adjust one variable at a time. Keep detailed notes."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "We believe in repair over replacement. Most espresso machine issues can be fixed with proper maintenance and quality replacement parts. Common repairs include group head gaskets, shower screens, pumps, and heating elements. Before considering a new machine, contact us for a diagnostic - we can often restore your machine to like-new condition for a fraction of the replacement cost."

                                <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Empty water tank or improperly seated tank, clogged water intake filter, air lock in the pump system, or faulty pump.
                            </div>
                            <div class="solution-list">
                                <strong>Solution:</strong> First, check that the water tank is full and properly seated - it should click into place. Remove the tank and clean the water intake filter (usually a small screen at the bottom). Run the machine without a portafilter attached to purge any air from the system. If the pump makes no noise at all when you try to brew, the pump may have failed and needs replacement.

                                <strong>Common Causes:</strong> Coffee ground too fine, too much coffee in the portafilter, over-tamping, or clogged shower screen/group head.

                                <strong>Solution:</strong> Adjust your grinder to a coarser setting (move one setting at a time). Use the correct dose - typically 18-20g for a double shot basket. Tamp with consistent pressure (about 30 pounds). Remove and clean the shower screen and check the group head gasket for coffee buildup. A proper extraction should take 25-30 seconds for a 2oz double shot.

                                <strong>Solution:</strong> Grind your coffee finer (adjust one setting at a time). Ensure you're using the proper dose for your basket size. Tamp evenly with 30 lbs of pressure - the puck should be level and firm. Most importantly, use fresh coffee beans roasted within the last 2-4 weeks. Old beans lose CO2 and won't produce proper extraction resistance.

                                <strong>Solution:</strong> The group head gasket should be replaced every 6-12 months depending on use. Make sure your portafilter locks tightly into the group head. Check the water tank for damaged seals and replace if necessary. During descaling, inspect visible internal hoses for cracks. Leaks from the bottom of the machine often indicate internal tube failure requiring professional repair.
